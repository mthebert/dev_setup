# Thebes' Mac OS X Dev Setup

I am always trying to put all of this stuff in one spot.  I had to change laptops at work, and was setting up my
environment and once again thought about how nice it would be to have all this stuff in one spot.  And then I found
this guy - https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup and it a) helped a ton and b) reminded me to do my own versions
of this stuff!

So - as a full-stack developer, I mostly use tools in the javascript and python realm.  And I definitely prefer
to use a Mac.  A lot of this is to support current projects at Hearst Autos and Car & Driver and some of these items
will be used to overcome some limitations and hurdles specific to my projects.

What are some things I am going to want to store in here:
.gitignore
README.md
eslint
bash stuff
Some good aliases
